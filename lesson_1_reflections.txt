How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I knew I was looking for a word that was misspelled in only one, so just had to check diff results for a misspelled word.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Correcting code, reusing old code, disaster recovery.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: pretty critical to understand where the code was if you're to go back to it Cons: if you forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git repos are more likely to have interdependent files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to identify the changes (based on the message or adding arguments), and diff to see what changed in the contents of those files
