When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other people, when wanting data backup, or when using multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working on features that are going to take more than one commit - so you don't break things while working on the feature.
