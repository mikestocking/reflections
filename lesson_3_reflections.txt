When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other people, when wanting data backup, or when using multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working on features that are going to take more than one commit - so you don't break things while working on the feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: when using Github to develop off someone else's work. Clones: when doing local development, but using remotes to track changes or share with others. Branches: When developing new features, or for seperating use cases.
