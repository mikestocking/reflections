What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git sets up a local repo. Otherwise there is not a basis for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory can contain changes that aren't ready to be committed. This offers more granularity/specificity in commits, without slowing down development.
